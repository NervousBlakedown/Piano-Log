The purpose of this repository is to help musicians practice and memorize their music with more efficiency.  Since there's strong correlation between music and math/science, I imagine several Github users practice musical instruments and will find this repo useful.

I used to get stressed out finding the most efficient way to use my practice time.  Since the brain learns by patterns and repetition (assuming the patterns are accurately-sized; you wouldn't read the whole Bible from beginning to end and be frustrated why you didn't memorize it successfully), I wanted a simple way to take all of the measures in a piece of music, put them in small phrases (in music, a typical phrase is usually four measures long), then increase the measure length in the same fixed time interval.

Included is a python file that takes the range of measures in your music, and puts them in phrases, then doubles them again.  By the time you practice the largest phrase sizes, you may have your music perfected!

I recommend practicing in ten-minute intervals using a physical timer (phones are distractions waiting to happen). This method can be changed as needed; practicing in five-minute or twenty-minute intervals can work as well.  You can also start smaller or bigger with the phrase size.  On average, it takes seven repetitions for the brain to retain a piece of information (sorry I don't have the citation with me right now).  Tracking time spent on each piece and time spent on each measure will make your practice time more effective.

There are multiple ways of doing this and other ways to improve this method.  Outputting the results directly into Excel or a text file is one option, and taking your numbers and making them a Pandas dataframe is another. Personally, I'm using an excel file to track all of the pieces I'm working on and adding formulae to count the expected vs. actual hours practiced. Feel free to take this repo and run with it.  Have fun making music!
